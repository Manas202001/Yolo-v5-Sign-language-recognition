# Sign-Language-Recognition-Using-Yolov5
This work proposes real-time sign language detection models for 
deaf and mute individuals created using the You Only Look Once version 
5 (YOLOv5) algorithm. There were 3 different models created. The first 
model detects American Sign Language, the Second model detects Hindi/ 
Marathi Sign Language and the third model detects static gestures.
